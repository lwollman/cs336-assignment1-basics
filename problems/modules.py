"""
Deliverable: Implement a Linear class that inherits from torch.nn.Module and performs a linear transformation. Your implementation should follow the interface of PyTorch’s built-in nn.Linear module, except for not having a bias argument or parameter. 
We recommend the following interface:
"""
import torch

class Linear():
    def __init__(
        self, 
        in_features, 
        out_features, 
        device=None, 
        dtype=None
        ): 
        """
        Construct a linear transformation module. This function should accept the following parameters:  in_features: int final dimension of the input  out_features: int final dimension of the output  device: torch.device | None = None Device to store the parameters on  dtype: torch.dtype | None = None Data type of the parameters):
        """
        self.weight = "TODO"
        print("do your homework")

    
    def forward(self, 
                x: torch.Tensor
                ) -> torch.Tensor: 
                """
                Apply the linear transformation to the input.  
                Make sure to:  
                subclass nn.Module  • call the superclass constructor  • construct and store your parameter as W (not W ⊤) for memory ordering reasons, putting it in an nn.Parameter  • of course, don’t use nn.Linear or nn.functional.linear
